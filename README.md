Working Papers
==============

This repository aims to provide information (data, codes) of my current working papers in empirical finance, econometrics, and text mining/webscraping. 

Further studies should pursue applications to asset allocation under conditions of market distress or to a user-specified scenario. In addition, I want to identify impactful news articles and construct news factor. One can apply machine learning techniques to identify relevant tags for a story and to understand which patterns can impact the market most.
